# IT Support Ticket Analysis & Dashboard in Excel ðŸ“Š

![Dashboard Preview](Excel Dashboard.png)

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes **97,498 IT support tickets** over a **5-year period** to uncover key insights into **IT helpdesk performance, agent efficiency, and customer satisfaction**.  
The work was done entirely in **Microsoft Excel**, using **data cleaning, data transformation, pivot tables, statistical analysis, and a dynamic dashboard** to support data-driven decision-making.

The analysis identifies:
- Performance trends and workload patterns
- Resolution time efficiency
- Satisfaction scores by issue type and agent
- Bottlenecks in processes (priority vs. severity mismatches)
- Recommendations for staffing, training, and technology upgrades

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- **Evaluate IT support efficiency** based on ticket volumes, resolution times, and user satisfaction.
- **Identify trends** in support requests over time and severity levels.
- **Analyze agent performance** to recognise top performers and highlight those needing training.
- **Recommend actions** to improve operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
- **Create a dynamic dashboard** for ongoing performance tracking.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Sources & Structure
Two datasets were used:
1. **Tickets Dataset** â€“ Ticket ID, category, issue type, resolution time, severity, priority, satisfaction rate, date, agent ID.
2. **IT Agents Dataset** â€“ Agent ID, name, email, date of birth, contact details, assigned tickets.

**Data Size:**  
- **Tickets:** 97,498 records  
- **Agents:** Multiple attributes for each IT support staff member

## ðŸ›  Methodology
**1. Data Cleaning**
- Corrected typos: e.g., `"Mayor"` â†’ `"Major"`, `"Unclasified"` â†’ `"Unclassified"`, `"Unassiged"` â†’ `"Unassigned"`.
- Ensured uniform formatting for categorical fields.
- Verified data integrity â€” no missing values.

**2. Data Transformation**
- Extracted email domains using Excel formulas.
- Calculated agent ages from birth dates.
- Created new fields for analysis (e.g., daily ticket volume, resolution time averages).

**3. Analysis**
- Pivot tables to calculate:
  - Daily, monthly, and yearly ticket volumes
  - Category-wise and severity-wise resolution times
  - Agent-wise performance metrics (resolution time & satisfaction rate)
- Correlation analysis between severity and resolution times.
- Trend analysis: seasonal, quarterly, and yearly patterns.

**4. Visualization**
- Created **dynamic, filterable Excel dashboard** with KPIs, charts, and slicers to enable real-time insight extraction.

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- **Ticket Volume Growth:** Increased consistently year-on-year; peak in Dec 2020.
- **Average Resolution Time:** 4.55 days overall â€” faster for urgent tickets, slower for "Normal" severity tickets (possible capacity issue).
- **Satisfaction Rate:** 4.10/5 average; higher for Major & Urgent tickets.
- **Category Trends:**
  - Longest to resolve: Hardware (7.63 days) & System issues (6.62 days).
  - Fastest: Login Access (~0.31 days).
- **Agent Performance:**
  - Top performers: Diana Rojo, Javier D., Jesus Grajeda, Galindo Guadalupe, Segura Garcia.
  - Areas of improvement for: Lorena, Elena Velez, Nurio Zepeda, Sandra Lujan, A. Trejo.
  - Older agents tend to have faster resolution times; younger agents score high on satisfaction.
- **Priority-Severity Gap:** 82% mismatch rate â€” automation could fix this.

## ðŸš€ Recommendations
1. **Upgrade Ticket Management Software** â€“ Automate priority assignment, improve queue management.
2. **Agent Training Programs** â€“ Address performance gaps and standardize service quality.
3. **Capacity Planning** â€“ Hire more agents if ticket growth continues.
4. **Workflow Automation** â€“ Faster routing, auto-responses for common issues.
